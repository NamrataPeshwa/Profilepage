I'm sorry that I was not able to complete the full submission and push the project to GitHub on time. Due to overlapping academic exams and time constraints, I couldn’t finalize the integration and upload process, though I worked extensively on the UI and core implementation. I understand the importance of completing this task and truly appreciate the opportunity. If allowed, I’d be happy to demonstrate the progress or share the local files directly.

Thank you for your understanding!
